Introduction
Today, Databases and their management are at the core of functioning in a world driven by data and connectivity. People encounter several activities every day that involve interaction with databases like banking, ticket booking, movie streaming, online shopping, and a lot more.
Two such areas that have databases at their core are the aviation and taxi industries. This opens up an opportunity to build an online database-backed service to let consumers findtheir airlines and taxis. The existing solutions do not integrate the process seamlessly, so we have developed a database that holds information about various airports in cities around the world, airlines operating between them, taxis stationed at these airports, and details of passengers opting for these services.
The complete integration of the airport management systemsand taxi management systems has many challenges and considerations which are discussed in detail in this report.
Some of the profound challenges were in the area of building an Entity Relationship Diagram, converting ERD to relational data, and normalizing the tables to achieve peak performance.On the other hand, the actual implementation of the project using SQL PL/SQL needed a good understanding of the language and deep database concepts like transaction, concurrency, triggers, and more. The project facilitates add, modify, delete and search functionalities in order to provide a fast, accurate and robust structure that can handle a big number of passenger transactions.
Letâ€™s discuss each of the crucial aspects of ER diagram, normalization, and code in detail in the following sections.
