CONCLUSION
Civil Aviation Industry is among the fastest-growing industries in India and beyond. 
And in local transit systems, Taxis have traditionally been incumbents and have shown sharp growth in consumer preference over public transport systems. 
Our project is at the intersection of these two high-growth, highscale industries. 
The Integration of the Airport Management System and Taxi Booking System aims to help find flights and taxis easily. 
The project holds various details which help the passenger find a flight of their favored airline and price, along with the ability to find and pre-book taxis at their destination airport. 
The underlying infrastructure is built and maintained using SQL and PL/SQL by carefully normalizing various tables to achieve an efficient search with minimal anomalies.
The project functionalities include cursors, procedures, and triggers.
